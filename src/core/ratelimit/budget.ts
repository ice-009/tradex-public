// Request budget for a rate-limited data API (Fyers Data APIs).
//
// Fyers limits (from 16 Oct 2026), Data APIs — quotes, history, depth, option chain:
//   Standard:   5 / second,  50 / minute,    5,000 / day; 50 symbols per quote call;  100 socket symbols
//   Prime:     10 / second, 500 / minute, 5,00,000 / day; 1,000 symbols per quote call; 5,000 socket symbols
// Going over a per-minute limit more than 3 times in a day blocks the account
// for the rest of the day, so this budget stays well inside every limit and
// treats a single 429 as a strike that pauses everything.
//
// Windows are counted by what Fyers can see, not by when we sent: a call takes
// a slot from the moment it's sent until one window-length after its response.
// Counting send times alone isn't enough — the first calls on a cold connection
// are held up by the TLS handshake and reach Fyers together with the next
// second's calls (that's how a 4/s send rate produced 429s at startup). With
// in-flight + recently-finished calls under the cap, no 1-second (or 1-minute)
// window at Fyers' end can hold more than the cap, whatever the latency.
//
// Callers ask by priority:
//   user        — something the person just asked for (open a chart, search, order ticket)
//   refresh     — keeping visible things current (watchlist, alerts)
//   background  — scans and sweeps nobody is waiting on (high/low scan, screener, backfill)
// Lower priorities may use only a share of each window, so a background sweep can
// never starve a chart, and the last part of the day is kept for the user.
//
// Pure: time is passed in. The server keeps one instance and persists `state`.
